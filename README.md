# Real-Time Object Detection Using YOLO11

A Computer Vision project that opens the webcam, detects the objects in each
frame using a pretrained YOLO11n model, and draws the results on screen while
showing live statistics.

---

## 1. Description

The application captures a live video feed, runs object detection on every
frame, and displays bounding boxes with the class name and confidence of each
detected object. A small panel shows how many objects were found, which classes
they belong to and the current frame rate.

It runs entirely from the terminal:

```bash
python -m app
```

The detection model is the pretrained **YOLO11n** model provided by
[Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/). This project does **not** train or
fine-tune a model — it is an application built around an existing one. The work
here is the capture loop, the integration with the model, the drawing of the
results, the statistics and the keyboard controls.

## 2. Features

- Live object detection on a webcam feed using pretrained YOLO11n
- Bounding boxes with class name and confidence score
- Real-time statistics: object count, class counts and FPS
- Adjustable confidence threshold while the program is running
- Save a snapshot of the annotated frame with one key press
- Session summary written to `outputs/session_summary.json`
- Automatic use of a GPU when one is available, otherwise CPU
- Clear error messages if the camera cannot be opened

## 5. Installation

Python 3.10 or newer is required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhijai10/real-time-object-detection-yolo11.git
cd real-time-object-detection-yolo11
```

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies. The commands differ
between operating systems, so use the block that matches your machine.

### Windows

The activation command depends on which shell you have open. Run the block for
your shell from the project folder.

PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If PowerShell refuses to run the activation script, allow it for the current
session only. This does not change the machine-wide setting:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Command Prompt:

```bat
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Git Bash:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `python` is not recognised, use the Windows `py` launcher instead
(`py -m venv .venv`), or re-run the Python installer and tick **Add python.exe
to PATH**.

> **Windows on ARM.** PyTorch, torchvision and OpenCV do not publish Windows
> ARM64 wheels, so an ARM64 build of Python cannot install these requirements.
> pip has to build OpenCV from source instead, which needs CMake and fails
> easily. Install the normal 64-bit (x64) Windows build of Python. On a Windows
> ARM64 machine that interpreter runs under Windows' own emulation and
> everything installs normally.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs Ultralytics, which also installs PyTorch. The download is large
(PyTorch alone is over 100 MB), so the first install takes a few minutes.

## 6. Running the application

```bash
python -m app
```

On the very first run, Ultralytics downloads the `yolo11n.pt` weights
(about 5 MB) and caches them. Later runs start immediately.

A window opens showing the live camera feed with the detection results drawn on
it. Press `Q` or `ESC` to quit.

### Command line options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--camera INDEX` | `0` | Which webcam to use |
| `--model PATH` | `yolo11n.pt` | Model weights to use |
| `--conf FLOAT` | `0.25` | Confidence threshold |
| `--width PIXELS` | driver default | Requested capture width |
| `--height PIXELS` | driver default | Requested capture height |

`--width` and `--height` must be given together.

```bash
python -m app --conf 0.40
python -m app --camera 1 --width 1280 --height 720
```

## 7. Keyboard controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Q` or `ESC` | Quit |
| `S` | Save a snapshot of the current annotated frame |
| `C` | Clear the session statistics |
| `+` / `-` | Increase or decrease the confidence threshold |

The same list is drawn in the corner of the window.

## 8. How it works

```
Webcam
  -> read a frame with OpenCV
  -> run YOLO11n inference on the frame
  -> collect the boxes, class names and confidences
  -> update the FPS and object counts
  -> draw the boxes, labels and statistics
  -> show the frame in the OpenCV window
  -> check for a key press
  -> repeat
```

Each of those steps lives in its own module:

- `camera.py` opens the webcam and reads frames.
- `detector.py` loads YOLO11n and converts the model output into a list of
  `Detection` objects (class name, confidence, bounding box).
- `analytics.py` measures FPS and counts the objects per class.
- `renderer.py` draws everything onto the frame.
- `controls.py` turns a key code into an action.
- `main.py` runs the loop that ties these together.

The model receives the frame and returns bounding boxes, a class index and a
confidence for each object it recognises. The confidence is how sure the model
is, from 0 to 1. Only objects above the confidence threshold are kept, and the
model's own non-maximum suppression removes overlapping duplicate boxes for the
same object.

### Example real webcam session

`outputs/session_summary.json` records what happened during a run. The file
below is the complete output of one real session recorded by the author on a
MacBook webcam. It is the author's sample session, **not** a benchmark, and the
numbers say nothing about how well YOLO11n performs in general:

```json
{
  "started_at": "2026-09-18T00:45:36",
  "duration_seconds": 74.32,
  "frames_processed": 1063,
  "total_detections": 1573,
  "most_objects_in_one_frame": 5,
  "average_detections_per_frame": 1.48,
  "average_confidence": 0.7388,
  "average_fps": 15.98,
  "peak_fps": 19.78,
  "most_frequent_class": "person",
  "class_totals": {
    "bottle": 3,
    "bowl": 22,
    "cell phone": 85,
    "chair": 7,
    "dog": 14,
    "fork": 2,
    "microwave": 44,
    "oven": 8,
    "person": 1290,
    "potted plant": 1,
    "refrigerator": 9,
    "toothbrush": 45,
    "tv": 37,
    "wine glass": 6
  }
}
```

The session was captured at camera index 0 through the AVFoundation backend, on
the Apple Silicon GPU (MPS), with the confidence threshold at 0.25. Frame rates
vary a lot between machines, so the FPS figures above are specific to this one
laptop and camera resolution.

## 9. Limitations

- Detection quality depends entirely on the pretrained YOLO11n model. It
  recognises the 80 classes in the COCO dataset and nothing else.
- Some objects are missed or given the wrong label, especially small, distant or
  partly hidden ones.
- Performance depends on the hardware, the camera resolution and the model size.
- Low light, motion blur and unusual viewing angles all reduce accuracy.
- No custom training was carried out, and **no accuracy benchmark is included**.
  The project does not report precision, recall or mAP, because that would
  require a labelled evaluation dataset that is not part of this project.
- Only one camera feed is processed at a time, and objects are not tracked
  between frames.

## 10. Testing

```bash
pytest -q
```

The tests cover argument parsing, camera error handling, detection structure,
confidence filtering, class counting, FPS calculation, session statistics and
the key mappings. They do not download the model or need a webcam, so they run
in a couple of seconds on any machine.

The tests check that the code behaves correctly. They say nothing about how
accurate the model is — that is not something unit tests can measure.

## 11. Future improvements

- Track objects between frames so each one keeps a stable ID
- Add an option to run detection on a recorded video file
- Support a custom-trained model for a specific set of classes
- Count objects crossing a line in the frame
- Reduce the inference resolution automatically when FPS drops
