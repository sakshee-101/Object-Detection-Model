"""Real-Time Object Detection Using YOLO11.

A small Computer Vision project that runs object detection on a live webcam
feed using the pretrained YOLO11n model, and draws the results on screen.

The detection model itself is third-party software from Ultralytics. Everything
in this package is the application built around it.
